# AutoShorts - AI-powered Shorts Generator

> [!WARNING]
> Unfortunately, I have stopped working on auto-shorts since it was just a learning project for me. I do not have time to continue working on the project. I will keep this project open for minor bug fixes, etc.

AutoShorts is a fully fledged package that generates shorts videos with the help of AI to write the script. It can generate popular types of video seen on YouTube Shorts and TikTok. However, there is a goal of making it more general and customizable to generate different types of videos for a wider use case.

If you want to support the development of this package, consider buying me a coffee:

# Introduction

For more information, visit the documentation at [AutoShorts Docs](https://alamshafil.github.io/auto-shorts/).

This project is built with a flexible abstraction layer which allows you to quickly create different types of videos with different AI tools and can be easily extended to include more types and tools internally.

This repo includes a CLI interface and JS interface. The CLI interface is built on top of the JS interface. The JS interface is the core of the package and can be used to generate videos programmatically.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in the early stages of development and may have bugs - especially when interacting with AI to generate scripts. This package is not meant to be used in production environments yet. Since AI output is unpredictable, work is being done to make the output more predictable and controllable. If the AI generates an incorrect JSON output, then you can manually edit the JSON output to fix the issue. This package is subject to change and may have breaking changes in the future. Use at your own risk.

# Features
You can generate popular types of short videos seen on YouTube Shorts and TikTok like:
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) videos
- Topic-based videos with images
- Text message story videos
- 'Would you rather' videos
- Ranking item videos
- And more...

The topic-based video type can be used to generate videos on a wide range of topics like:
- News-related videos
- Educational videos
- Fun facts videos
- And more...

| Text Message Video | News Video | Quiz Video | Rank Video | Would You Rather Video |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Text Message Video](docs/docs/intro/images/msg.jpeg) | ![News Video](docs/docs/intro/images/news.jpeg) | ![Quiz Video](docs/docs/intro/images/quiz.jpeg) | ![Rank Video](docs/docs/intro/images/rank.jpeg) | ![Would You Rather Video](docs/docs/intro/images/rather.jpeg) |

You can request new video types and tools to be added to the package by creating an issue on the GitHub repo.

# Using local LLMs via Ollama

Note: By default, the package use Ollama to generate scripts. Therefore a working Ollama installation is required. It is recommended to use the `llama3.2` model for fast results. 

You can install this model by running the following command: `ollama pull llama3.2`. 

Using other local models may result in incorrect output.

You can use other AI APIs such as OpenAI ChatGPT 4o, Google Gemini AI, and Anthropic Claude by providing the necessary API keys and setting the `aiType` parameter to the appropriate value.

# Install UI Manually

AutoShorts comes with a web UI that allows you to generate videos with a simple interface. The UI is built with Next.js and Express.js. The web UI relies on the backend server. 

> [!NOTE]
> The web UI is in the early stages of development and may have bugs. The UI is not meant to be used in production environments yet. If you encounter any issues, please create an issue on the GitHub repo. Feel free to contribute to the UI by creating a pull request.

This example will clone the repository and start the backend server and frontend server.

## Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alamshafil/auto-shorts
cd auto-shorts
npm install
npm run install-ui-deps
npx auto-shorts --download
```

## Setup backend server

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file in the root directory and fill in the necessary information:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The sample `.env` file by default uses the following environment variables:

```bash
# # LLMs
# OPENAI_API_KEY="key here"
# GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="key here"
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="key here"
# # TTS
# ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="key here"
# NEETS_API_KEY="key here"
# # Image
# PEXELS_API_KEY="key here"

# Backend Server Config
SERVER_RES_PATH="res" # Download from "npx auto-shorts --download [path]"
SERVER_TEMP_PATH="video_temp" # Can be any path like "video_temp"
SERVER_IP="localhost"
SERVER_PORT=3001 # Can be any port number like 3001
```

You can provide the necessary API keys for the AI tools and image generation tools in the `.env` file by uncommenting the necessary lines and providing the keys.

You can also change the backend server configuration like the resource path, temporary path, IP, and port number.

## Setup frontend server

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file in the `ui` folder and fill in the necessary information:

```bash
cp ui/.env.example ui/.env
```

The sample `ui/.env` file by default uses the following environment variables:

```bash
# Server Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3001" # Use the same port number as the backend server (ex: http://localhost:3001)
```

If you changed the port number in the backend server configuration, make sure to change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to the same port number. In this case, the port number is 3001.

Then, run the following commands to start the backend server and frontend server:

```bash
npm run start-all
```

The web UI should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Install UI with Docker (experimental)

Using Docker is a experimental way to get started with the AutoShorts UI. The Docker image contains all the necessary dependencies and resources to run the UI and backend server.

> [!WARNING]
> The Docker image has not been published yet as of writing this. You can build the Docker image locally by following the instructions below. These instructions will be updated if a Docker image is published.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Clone the repository

First, clone the AutoShorts repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alamshafil/auto-shorts
cd auto-shorts
```

## Build the Docker image

Next, build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t auto-shorts .
```

## Run the Docker container

Finally, run the Docker container. This will start the AutoShorts UI on port 3000 and the backend server on port 3001.

> [!NOTE]
> The AutoShorts UI is under development and may have bugs. It currently relies on using client-side fetch to connect to the backend server. This is why port 3001 is also exposed. Port 11434 is for the Ollama server.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 3001:3001 11434:11434 auto-shorts
```

The AutoShorts UI should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Install CLI (global)

Note: Since LLMs can hallucinate and are not deterministic, the videos may not generate the expected output. You can manually edit the JSON output to fix the issue.

```bash
# Install the package globally
npm install -g auto-shorts

# Download the necessary resources (to './res' folder by default)
npx auto-shorts --download

# Generate a video with AI (will find the necessary resources in the './res' folder)
# You have options to use different AI tools to generate the script, voice, and image

# Use OpenAI gpt-4o-mini to generate the script, ElevenLabs to generate the voice, and Pexels to generate the image
npx auto-shorts -p "make a news short about TypeScript" --aiType OpenAIGen --ttsType ElevenLabs --imageType Pexels --elevenLabsAPIKey YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY --pexelsAPIKey YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY --openaiAPIKey YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

# Use local Ollama llama3.2 to generate the script, Built-in TTS to generate the voice, and Google Scraper to generate the image (default, no need to provide API keys)
npx auto-shorts -p "make a news short about TypeScript"
```

You can also run the command interactively and provide the necessary information when prompted:
```bash
npx auto-shorts
```

For help:
```bash
npx auto-shorts --help
```

# Install JS interface with example (npm)

First, make sure to install the package and download the necessary resources.

```bash
# Install the package
npm install auto-shorts

# Download the necessary resources (to './res' folder by default)
npx auto-shorts --download
```

You will need to download the necessary resources before running the code. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npx auto-shorts --download [path]
```
